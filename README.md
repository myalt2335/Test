# Verbal: Quick Overview

I created a simple and intuitive coding language. Here are the basics:

## Variables

To assign a variable, use this format:

```
x is 100
```

To access a variable, ask for its value:

```
whats x?
```

This will print the value of `x` (e.g., 100).

## Basic Math Operations

You can perform basic math operations by asking:

- **Addition**:  
  `whats x plus y?`
  
- **Subtraction**:  
  `whats x minus y?`
  
- **Multiplication**:  
  `whats x times y?`
  
- **Division**:  
  `whats x divided by y?`

## Loops

To create an infinite loop:

```
repeat hello forever
```

Optionally, add a delay:

```
repeat hello forever
    but don't say it too fast, just every 3 seconds
that's it
```

## Conditionals

You can create conditionals like this:

```
if x is greater than y
    say x is larger
or if not
    say y is larger
that's it
```

## Functions

To define a function:

```
add with numbers a and b
    whats a plus b?
that's it
```

To call the function:

```
whats add with numbers a and b?
```

## Input/Output (I/O)

**Output**:  
To print the value of `x`:
```
whats x?
```

## Comments

Comments are prefixed with `note`:

```
note this is a comment
```

## Sample Script

```
x is 3
y is 7

if x is greater than y
    say x is larger
or if not
    say y is larger
that's it

loop through numbers x to y
    whats the current number?
thats it

add with numbers x and y
    whats a plus b?
thats it

result is whats add with x and y?
whats result?

repeat hello forever
    but don't say it too fast, just every 3 seconds
thats it
```
