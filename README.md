Was bored and made another coding language. Stuff:

# Variables:

To assign a variable, simply say what the name is and the value
Ex: x is 100

To access a variable, simply say:

What's x?

and it will print the value assigned to x, for example 100.

# Basic math operations

Addition:

Whats x plus y?

Subtraction:

Whats x minus y?

Multiplication:

Whats x times y?

Division:

Whats x divided by y?

# Loops

Its easy to define loops:

loop through numbers 1 to 5
    whats the current number?
thats it

Line 1 defines that its looping through 1 through 5, then it asks for the number, and "thats it" is "end"

you can also say:

repeat hello forever

to print a value on loop forever

optionally to have it sleep:

repeat hello forever
	but dont say it too fast just every 3 seconds
thats it

# conditionals
An example would be:

if x is greater than y
    say x is larger
or if not
    say y is larger
thats it

This tells it to compare two variables and what to do with them this also shows an example of if/then

# functions
just say

add with numbers a and b
    whats a plus b?
thats it

to call a function, such as the example above:

whats add with numbers a and b?


# I/O

Output:
Ex: whats x?

# Comments

A comment in this language would be

note this is a comment


# A sample script could be:

x is 3
y is 7

if x is greater than y
    say x is larger
or if not
    say y is larger
thats it

loop through numbers x to y
    whats the current number?
thats it

add with numbers x and y
    whats a plus b?
thats it

result is whats add with x and y?    note this is defining a variable that isn't a single character equal to a number, but one equal to a function result
whats result?

repeat hello forever
	but dont say it too fast just every 3 seconds
thats it
